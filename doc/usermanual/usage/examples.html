    <H1 id="title">QuickFIX/J: Example Applications</H1>
  <p>TODO edit the example text  
    <p>QuickFIX comes with several example applications. These application are in the <B>quickfix/examples</B>
  directory. These applications are not meant to demonstrate good application design or meant
  to be used in a real production system. They are merely provided as a tutorial on how to build an
  application with QuickFIX.
    <p>
  <p>
  The applications provided are <B>ordermatch</B> which is a c++ server that will match and execute limit
  orders, and <B>tradeclient</B> is a little c++ console based trading client. <B>Banzai</B> is a Java GUI based
  trading client. Finally there is <B>executor</B>. Executor is a server that simply fills every limit order that
  it receives. Executor has been implemented in <I>C++, Java, C#, VB.NET and Python</I>. This is a great example for demonstrating how
  to do the same things in all of QuickFIX's supported API's.
  </p>

  <p>
  Please study these examples to see a complete although minimal implementation of a FIX application.
