To do:
* Implement block/poll in socket acceptor

* Run acceptance tests for all FIX version and client

It looks like there is a getString() method on Field? If so,
we may want to refactor the references to StringField.

XML generation should be cleaned up a bit.

Issues:

* There are various places where exceptions are thrown but not
declared. I'm not sure about the best way to handle these.

Extensions:

Routing
Allowed message types
Heartbeat interval defaults in atests
