<H1 id="title">QuickFIX/J: Receiving Messages</H1>
<p> Most of the messages you will be interested in looking at will be arriving
  in your overloaded <B>fromApp</B> function of your application. You can get
  fields out of messages with different degrees of type safety. The type in question
  here is the FIX message type. When the application passes you a <B>Message</B> class,
  the C++ type checker has no idea what specific FIX message it is, you must
  determine that dynamically. There is, however, a way we can make C++ aware
  of this type information. First we will cover how to dynamically retreive fields
  from a message, then we will show you the prefered type safe way. Keep in mind
  that all messages have a header and a trailer. If you want to see fields in
  them, you must first call <B>getHeader()</B> or <B>getTrailer()</B> to get
  access to them. Otherwise you use them just like the message. </p>
<H2>Least Type Safe</H2>
<p> This method of retreiving data from messages is <b>strongly discouraged</b> and
  is generally only useful for writing more low level interfaces for other languages
  and middleware. </p>
<pre><code>
import quickfix.*;

public void fromApp(Message message, SessionID sessionID)
  throws FieldNotFound, UnsupportedMessageType, IncorrectTagValue {

  StringField field = new StringField(44);
  message.getField(field);
}    
</code></pre>
<H2>More Type Safe</H2>
<p> A way to add some type safety to this is by using field classes that represent
  all the FIX defined fields. This is sometimes useful in an application, but
  is generally only used within code segments that need to be version independent
  (meaning versions of FIX). For example, our Session class is implemented using
  mostly these. It is generally not recomended for most applications. This will
  also get fields as their appropriate type, not just as strings. </p>
<pre>
<code>
import quickfix.*;
import quickfix.field.*;

public void fromApp(Message message, SessionID sessionID)
  throws FieldNotFound, UnsupportedMessageType, IncorrectTagValue {

  Price price = new Price();
  message.getField(price);

  ClOrdID = new ClOrdID();
  message.getField(clOrdID);
}
	</code>
</pre>
<H2>Most Type Safe... DO THIS!</H2>
<p> Here is the most type safe and <B>highly encouraged</B> method for retreiving
  data from a message. QuickFIX has message classes that correlate to all the
  messages defined in the spec. They are, just like the field classes, generated
  directly off of the FIX specifications. To take advantage of this, you must
  break the messages out with the supplied <B>MessageCracker</B>. Also notice
  we are no longer using a generic <B>Message</B> class and we are now using <B>get</B> instead
  of <B>getField</B>. Keep in mind you can still use <B>getField</B> as all of
  these classes derive from <B>Message</B> </p>
<pre><code>
import quickfix.*;
import quickfix.field.*;

public void fromApp(Message message, SessionID sessionID)
  throws FieldNotFound, UnsupportedMessageType, IncorrectTagValue {

  crack(message, sessionID);
}

public void onMessage( quickfix.fix42.NewOrderSingle message, SessionID sessionID )
  throws FieldNotFound, UnsupportedMessageType, IncorrectTagValue {

  ClOrdID clOrdID = new ClOrdID();
  message.get(clOrdID);

  ClearingAccount clearingAccount = new ClearingAccount();
  message.get(clearingAccount);
}

public void onMessage( quickfix.fix42.OrderCancelRequest message, SessionID sessionID )
  throws FieldNotFound, UnsupportedMessageType, IncorrectTagValue {

  ClOrdID clOrdID = new ClOrdID();
  message.get(clOrdID);

  // compile time error!! field not defined for OrderCancelRequest
  ClearingAccount clearingAccount = new ClearingAccount();
  message.get(clearingAccount);
}    
</code></pre>
<p> In order to use this you must use the <B>MessageCracker</B> as a mixin to
  your application. This will provide you with the <B>crack</B> function and
  allow you to overload specific message functions. Any function you do not overload
  will by default throw an <B>UnsupportedMessageType</B> exception</p>
  <p>
  Define your application like this: </p>
<pre><code>
import quickfix.Application;
import quickfix.MessageCracker;

public class MyApplication
  extends MessageCracker implements quickfix.Application
</code></pre>
