<p>TODO Acceptance Test Descriptions</p>
<p> QuickFIX also has a scriptable test runner that comes with a series of automated
  acceptance test. The basic tests that come with QuickFIX are based off of the <a href="http://www.fixprotocol.org/ORGANIZATIONS/928202077/FIX_TestCase_SessionLevel20010710.doc"> FIX
  Session-level Test Cases and Expected Behaviors</a> document produced by the
  FIX protocol organization. These tests verify that QuickFIX adheres to the
  FIX specifications. The automated nature of these tests guarantees that future
releases of QuickFIX will not break any current functionality. </p>
<p> Perhaps even more importantly is how these test are used to drive the development
  of QuickFIX. Before a line of code is written in support of a protocol feature,
  one of these tests is written. This test first approach sets up a goal for
  developers who will have objective verification that they correctly implemented
  the standard. </p>
<p> Below is an example of a test script that tests the engines behavior when
  it receives a NewSeqNo value that is less than the expected MsgSeqNum. </p>

In these script there are two types of commands, action commands and messages
commands. Action commands begin with lowercase letters while message command
begin with uppercase letters.
<h2>Action Commands</h2>
<b>i&lt;ACTION&gt;</b> - initiates an action<br>
<b>e&lt;ACTION&gt;</b> - expect (wait for) an action<br>
<br>
Supported actions are:<br>
<br>
<b>iCONNECT</b> - initiate connection to a FIX acceptor<br>
<b>eCONNECT</b> - expect a connection from a FIX initiator<br>
<b>iDISCONNECT</b> - initiate a disconnect<br>
<b>eDISCONNECT</b> - expect a disconnect<br>
<br>
<h2>Message Commands</h2>
<b>I&lt;MESSAGE&gt;</b> - initiate (send) a message<br>
<b>E&lt;MESSAGE&gt;</b> - expect (wait for) a message<br>
<br>
<p> When using the <b>I</b> command, you do not need to add the <i>Length(9)</i> or
  the <i>CheckSum(10)</i> fields, they will be added for you with the correct
  values in the appropriate locations. The only time you would add these fields
  is if you intentionally wish to make them incorrect. </p>
<p> The <b>I</b> command also provides a TIME macros for fields. By setting a
  field equal to &lt;TIME&gt;, the current system time will be placed in the
  field. (i.e. 52=<time>). You can also use offsets such as 52=&lt;TIME-120> or
  52=&lt;TIME+15> in order to set the time plus or minus some seconds from the
  current time. </p>
<p>The <b>E</b> command verifies that you have received the correct message.
  This command will compare the values of each field to make sure they are correct.
  Some fields cannot be verified deterministically before run-time such as the
  SendingTime and CheckSum fields. These fields can be added to the <i>fields.fmt</i> file
  where a regular expression can be defined to at least verify the field is in
  the correct format. For example: </p>
10=\d{3}, checksum must be exactly three digits<br>
52=\d{8}-\d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2}, sending time must be in the form of DDDDDDDD-DD:DD:DD
where D is a digit.
