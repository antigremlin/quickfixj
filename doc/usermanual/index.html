<h1>About QuickFIX/J</h1>
<p> If you have downloaded this package, you are probably already know about
  FIX. If not, this simple explanation from the <a href="http://www.fixprotocol.org/">FIX
  protocol organizaion</a> may help.</p>
<blockquote>The Financial Information Exchange (FIX) Protocol is a message standard
  developed to facilitate the electronic exchange of information related to securities
  transactions. It is intended for use between trading partners wishing to automate
  communications.</blockquote>
<p>That being said, the purpose of FIX is to make communication between financial
  vendors trivial, leaving them to focus on their core business. The FIX organization
  also specifically cites that openness has been key to their success. QuickFIX
  intends on expanding the openness of FIX into not just the specification of,
  but also the implementation of the protocol.</p>
<p>So what is QuickFIX? Simple. QuickFIX is a free and open source implementation
  of the FIX protocol. QuickFIX is not crippled, all of the source is open for
  all supported versions of FIX. There is no upgrade to a commercial version.</p>
<p>It is our hope that the trading community will work together to help lower
  the barrier in doing business with each other. QuickFIX is a step in that direction. </p>
